## 4. Data Source
The dashboard is built on a synthetic dataset containing 1M rows and 20 columns. The data was generated to mimic real-world OLA ride patterns, including booking details, ride status, customer IDs, reasons for cancellation, ride value, and ratings. It is designed purely for analytical and visualization purposes and does not represent actual company data.

## 5. Hightlights
Business Problem : The ride-hailing industry processes millions of bookings each month, yet mobility companies, customers, and analysts often lack an intuitive way to analyze booking trends, cancellation behavior, revenue flows, and customer satisfaction. This gap makes it difficult to identify operational inefficiencies, reduce cancellations, and optimize customer experience.

What was the daily booking trend across the month?
Which vehicle type generated the most revenue?
What are the top reasons for ride cancellations?
What was the total revenue for June, and how is it distributed across vehicle types?...etc difficult to answer quickly with raw data.
